        "\n",
        "A RESTful API is an application programming interface that follows the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer), an architectural style used for designing networked applications. In a RESTful API, we use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources, which are usually represented in formats like JSON or XML. Each resource is identified by a unique URL, and communication between the client and server is stateless, meaning each request contains all the information needed to process it. By following REST principles such as statelessness, client-server separation, and uniform interfaces, we are able to build scalable, flexible, and easily maintainable web services that can be used across different platforms and devices.\n"

        "\n",
        "Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python that we use to build web applications and APIs quickly and efficiently. It is considered a microframework because it provides the essential tools needed for web development, such as routing, request handling, and response generation, without forcing us to use a specific project structure or additional components. This simplicity gives us full control and flexibility while developing APIs. Flask is popular for building APIs because it is easy to learn, has minimal setup requirements, integrates well with databases and other libraries, and allows us to scale our application by adding extensions only when needed. Its clear design and strong community support make it a reliable and efficient choice for developing RESTful services and backend systems."

        "\n",
        "we use HTTP methods to define the type of operation we want to perform on a resource. The most commonly used methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. We use GET to retrieve data from the server without modifying it, POST to create a new resource, PUT to update an existing resource completely, and DELETE to remove a resource. PATCH is used when we want to partially update a resource instead of replacing it entirely. These methods follow standard web protocols and help us clearly communicate our intentions to the server, making RESTful APIs structured, predictable, and easy to maintain."

        "the @app.route() decorator is used to define a URL route and connect it to a specific function in our application. It tells the framework which function should run when a particular URL is accessed in the browser or through an API request. By using @app.route(), we map a web address, such as “/” or “/users”, to a Python function that handles the request and returns a response. We can also specify which HTTP methods, like GET or POST, are allowed for that route. This decorator helps us organize our application’s structure by clearly linking URLs to the logic that processes incoming requests."

        "Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that simplifies database integration in our web applications by providing an easy way to use SQLAlchemy with Flask. It acts as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), which means we can interact with our database using Python classes and objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. With Flask-SQLAlchemy, we define database tables as models, perform queries using Python methods, and manage relationships between tables in a structured way. Its role is to make database operations cleaner, more organized, and easier to maintain, while also handling connections and configurations efficiently within a Flask application."

We write a function that returns a response, such as a simple text message, and use the @app.route() decorator to map a URL path to that function. After defining the route, we add a condition to run the application using app.run() so that the development server starts when we execute the file. When we run the script and open the specified local address in our browser, we see the response generated by our function, which confirms that our basic Flask application is working properly."

The most common way we do this is by using the jsonify() function provided by Flask, which automatically converts the data into a properly formatted JSON response and sets the correct MIME type (application/json). We simply return jsonify(data) from our route function, and Flask handles the serialization for us. This approach ensures that our API responses are structured, readable, and easily consumable by frontend applications or other services\n"

For example, we can use request.form to get form fields or request.get_json() to read JSON data. After processing the received information, we return an appropriate response, often in JSON format, confirming that the data was received and handled successfully.\n",

We specify the error code, for example @app.errorhandler(404), and link it to a function that returns a custom response when that error occurs. Inside the function, we can return a custom HTML page or a JSON response along with the appropriate status code, such as return jsonify({\"error\": \"Page not found\"}), 404. This approach allows us to provide user-friendly messages and consistent API responses instead of showing the default error page, making our application more professional and easier to use."

We create a Blueprint object in a separate file, define routes inside it just like we do with the main app, and then register that Blueprint in our main application file using app.register_blueprint(). This allows us to group related routes, templates, and static files together based on features or functionality, such as users, products, or authentication. By structuring our app with Blueprints, we improve code organization, maintainability, and scalability, especially when working on larger projects or in team environments."
